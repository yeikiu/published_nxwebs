## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **ROLE-DISC Archetype System**
Fight Radar uses a proprietary **ROLE-DISC** classification system to categorize fighters into tactical archetypes:

- 🔴 **AT (Active Technical)** - Strategic pressure fighters
- 🟡 **ANT (Active Non-Technical)** - Explosive, chaotic fighters
- 🔵 **PT (Passive Technical)** - Counter-strikers and snipers
- 🟢 **PNT (Passive Non-Technical)** - Defensive tanks

Fighters can have **dual** or even **triple** archetypes, revealing tactical versatility.

### 2. **Dual Radar Analysis**

**Fight Radar** (Performance Metrics)
- Striking Offense & Defense
- Takedown Offense & Defense
- Ground Control
- Finish Threat

**IQ Radar** (Tactical Intelligence)
- Distance Management
- Adaptability
- Composure
- Decision Making
- Pace Control
- Feints & Setup

### 3. **Enhanced Opponent Tier Score**
Our algorithm evaluates fighter strength-of-schedule by analyzing:
- Opponent quality (Elite/Contender/Solid/Mediocre)
- Win/Loss outcomes
- Method of victory
- Recency weight (recent fights matter more)

### 4. **Smart Fight Predictions**
AI-powered predictions analyze:
- Historical performance data
- Fighting styles matchup
- Archetype compatibility
- Recent form and momentum
- Betting market insights
